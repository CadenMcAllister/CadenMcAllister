# 👋 Hi, I’m Caden McAllister

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a high school student building a foundation in software development through hands-on projects and experimentation.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- 🔧 Web development with [FlutterFlow](https://flutterflow.io/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- 📱 Beginning to learn [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to move beyond no-code tools and build fully customized apps

## 💾 Past Experience

- 🕹️ **[Untitled Grocery Game](https://murkybubbles7772.itch.io/untitled-grocery-wizard-robot-game)** – A Unity game where you play as a wizard navigating fighting robots in a grocery store. Made in 2023 using C#
- 💡 Earlier explorations in game development and interactive tools with Unity and C#
- 📰 **[What Did I Miss?] (https://preview.flutterflow.app/what-did-i-miss-b7l8z1/JKDGdEQloheYlNiN7cAX)** – A personal dashboard that summarizes what you missed while offline — across numerous news sources and topics — and delivers it as a clean, in-app markdown report  
- 🧭 **[Gyro Helper](https://preview.flutterflow.app/lego-spike-prime-gyro-heading-efbkfr/6tBk0Stvt4OWk9Hh5Ykt)** – A mobile-friendly compass utility designed aiding developers in their projects with LEGO Spike Prime robotics. It lets users track heading, save reference points, and recall them during testing

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- Current work as I transition into fully coded Flutter apps
- Projects built with FlutterFlow + Supabase
- Archived Unity/C# projects from my earlier dev phase

Thanks for stopping by!
